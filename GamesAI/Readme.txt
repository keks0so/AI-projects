This is an AI with ML learning to play chrome dino using a custom environment and libraries like pytesseract, gym, numpy, opencv, matplotlib. I used stable_baselines3 as the base for the model. It was trained for about 20 hours to get a score of 1000.
How to train: start the dino game and run the code (the code box should be on the right side of the screen)
