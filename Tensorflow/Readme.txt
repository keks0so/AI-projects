In this repository I have 2 projects that i'be done with Tensorflow + Keras
1) ML1.ipynb and ML2.ipynb - code that used to train AI multiclass ML model for detecting hand jestchures for game "Rock, paper, scisors"
2) rps1.ipynb - testing model for "Rock paper scisors" 
3) train(1/2/3).ipynb and f_tf.py - model for detecting and tracking raised hands that used ML and tensorflow + keras
