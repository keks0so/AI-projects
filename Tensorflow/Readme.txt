This repository contains 2 projects I made on Tensorflow + Keras
1) ML1.ipynb and ML2.ipynb - code used to train a multi-class ML artificial intelligence model to detect handwritten jokes for the game "Rock, paper, scisors".
2) rps1.ipynb is the test model for the game "Rock paper scisors" 
3) train(1/2/3).ipynb and f_tf.py - model for detecting and tracking raised hands, which used ML and tensorflow + keras
